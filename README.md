# External sites

This application allows an admin to add a link in the Nextcloud web interface
Apps menu that points to an external website. By simply entering the URL and
the name for the external site, an icon appears. When this icon is clicked by a
user, the external website appears in the Nextcloud frame. For the user, this
external site appears as if it is part of Nextcloud but, in fact, this can be
any external URL.

## **ðŸ›  State of maintenance**

While there are many things that could be done to further improve this app, the app is currently maintained with **limited effort**. This means:

- The main functionality works for the majority of the use cases
- We will ensure that the app will continue to work like this for future releases and we will fix bugs that we classify as 'critical'
- We will not invest further development resources ourselves in advancing the app with new features
- We do review and enthusiastically welcome community PR's

We would be more than excited if you would like to collaborate with us. We will merge pull requests for new features and fixes. We also would love to welcome co-maintainers.

## OCS API

It is also possible to get the sites via an OCS endpoint. The request must be authenticated.
Only sites for the userÂ´s language are returned:
```bash
curl  -H "OCS-APIRequest: true" \
  https://admin:admin@localhost/ocs/v2.php/apps/external/api/v1
```

### Response

### ETag / If-None-Match

The API provides an ETag for the sites array. In case the ETag matches the given value, a `304 Not Modified` is delivered together with an empty response body.

### Capability

The app registers a capability, so clients can check that before making the actual OCS request:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<ocs>
 ...
 <data>
  <capabilities>
   ...
   <external>
    <v1>
     <element>sites</element>
     <element>device</element>
     <element>groups</element>
     <element>redirect</element>
    </v1>
   </external>
   ...
```
